            <h1>HillCorp</h1>
            <h2>The Modern Phenomenon</h2>
            <p>Since 2008, HillCorp has had a mission of changing the world and making it a better place to live. Our endless supply of groundbreaking products has led us to become the largest company in the world by a considerable large margin, rising $4 trillion in net worth in the last two years. We have created the first fully-functioning humanoid AI and now have the best range of computers, devices, cars, AI and Corporate Analytics software. Read the story below about how our company made it to the top of the world, and how, with the Mars Ark project, we will go past the top of the world.</p>

        <h2>HillCorp's Begginnings</h2>
        <p>The HillCorp Company was founded on April 1, 2006, by Jeff Hill and his father, Graham Hill. The company's first product was the Hill Cougar, an electric car. This was first shown to the public at the Homebrew Car Club in October of 2007. The Cougar went on sale in July 2008 and was market-priced at $16,999.
            <br><br>
            HillCorp Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 2011, without Graham Hill, who had died 3 months earlier and left his son to run the company. Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of Hill industries. During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 2010 and September 2013, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.
            <br><br>
            The Hill II, also invented by Jeff, was introduced on April 16, 2011, at the first West Coast Computer Faire. It differs from its major rivals, the Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh, because of its ability to perform basic machine learning, which would later lead to the AVA project. While early Hill II models used fixed architecture instead of dynamic windows, the late-2011 update saw the introduction of the dynamic windows.</p>

        <div>
            <p>The Hill II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the newest "killer application" of the business world: Corpalytics, an analytics program originally started in 2013. Corpalytics created a business market for the Hill II and gave home users an additional reason to buy a Hill II: compatibility with the office. Before Corpalytics, HillCorp had been a distant third place competitor to Apple and Microsoft.
                <br><br>
                By the end of 2013, HillCorp had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The company introduced the Hill III in May 2014 in an attempt to compete with Apple in the business and corporate computing market.
                <br><br>
                Hill and several HillCorp employees, including human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in December 2014 to see a demonstration of the new breakthrough they had made in the world of AI.
                <br><br>
                Xerox granted HillCorp engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares of HillCorp at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.</p>

        <h2>Becoming The Frontrunner</h2>
        <p>Hill was immediately convinced that all future computers would use advanced machine learning AI, and development of HillCorp’s first AI began for the HillCorp Lisa. In 2015, however, he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting. Hill then took over Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the Mercury, and redefined it as a graphical system cheaper and faster than Lisa.
            <br> <br>
            In 2015, Lisa became the first personal computer sold to the public with an advanced AI system, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software titles, so in 2016 it would be repurposed as the high end Mercury and discontinued in its second year.
            <br> <br>
            On December 12, 2013, HillCorp (ticker symbol "HCRP") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $33 per share, generating over $150 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Apple in 1980. By the end of the day, the stock rose to $39 per share and 300 millionaires were created. HillCorp’s market cap was $1.778 billion at the end of its first day of trading.
            <br> <br>
            In 2016, HillCorp launched the Mercury, the first personal computer to be sold with a built-in semi-conscious AI system. Its debut was signified by "2016", a $30.5 million television advertisement series directed by Ridley Scott that originally aired three times during Super Bowl L on January 22, 2016. This is now hailed as a watershed event for HillCorp’s major success and was called a "masterpiece" by CNN and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide.

        <h2>Rise of the Mercury and Fall of HillCorp</h2>
        <p>Mercury sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months due to its high price, slow speed, and limited range of available software. In early 2017, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Jeff Hill and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired two years earlier by Hill using the famous line, "Do you want to sell broken watches for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?". Sculley decided to remove Hill as the general manager of the Mercury division, and gained unanimous support from the HillCorp board of directors.
            <br> <br>
            The board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Hill and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Hill attempted to oust him from his leadership role at HillCorp. Informed by Jean-Louis Gassée, Sculley found out that Hill had been attempting to organize a coup and called an emergency executive meeting at which HillCorp’s executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Hill of all operational duties. Hill resigned from HillCorp in September 2017 and took a number of HillCorp employees with him to found NoU Inc. which was intended as a slap in the face to HillCorp.

            <p>Hill’s brother had also quit his active employment at the company earlier in 2016 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with HillCorp’s treatment of the Hill II division and stating that the company had "been going in the wrong direction for the last five years".
                <br> <br>
                Despite Hill’s brother’s grievances, he left the company amicably and both Hill and his brother remained HillCorp shareholders. Hill’s brother continues to represent the company at events or in interviews, receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year for this role.
                <br><br>
                The outlook on Mercury improved with the introduction of the BeamWriter, the first reasonably priced self-driven laser printer, and a desktop publishing application released in July 2017. It has been suggested that the combination of Mercury, BeamWriter, and LeafMaker was responsible for the creation of the self-driven desktop publishing market.

        <h2>HillCorp's Resurgance</h2>
        <p>The HillBook, released in 2018, is HillCorp’s first battery-powered portable personal computer. After the departures of Hill and his brother, the Mercury product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called "high-right policy" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Hill had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1,000 price for the Mercury, which they were unable to meet.
            <br> <br>
            Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in power. Selling Mercury at such high profit margins was only possible because of its dominant position in the self-driven desktop publishing market. This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new self-driven desktop publishing programs appeared on PC clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Mercury but at far lower price points.
            <br> <br>
            The company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 2018 is the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in HillCorp’s stock price. During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 2019 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.
            <br> <br>
            Gassée left the company later that year. In October 2019, Apple introduced three lower-cost models, the Mercury Classic, Mercury LC, and Mercury IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand. In mid-2019, Jeff Hill bought back the company and fired Sculley and anyone who ousted him in the years before.

            <p>Under Hill’s new leadership in 2019, HillCorp had the biggest product release event of all-time. They released two new Smartphone lines, the Tokyo and Crete ranges which were aimed at the lower price-bracket then their previous smartphones, the avalanche range. They also announced the new Surface range, which was a high-end range of laptops which had cutting-edge technology.
                <br> <br>
                However the biggest development from that event and Hill’s brainchild for the last 10 years, had been AVA. The new AI system that will change the world. It is the smartest, most complex AI system ever and is the first available for sale. With that came the smart home, the AVAbook and HillCorp’s new premium service, HillCorp Infinity.
                <br> <br>
                HillCorp have also just announced that we are going to Mars in a partnership with NASA and SpaceX. Also we have just gone back to our roots and re-entered the car market with the new self-driving Fayonette and the Astro. HillCorp became the biggest company in the world after these products were released with an estimated value of $5.6 trillion, 5 times more than Apple or Microsoft.
