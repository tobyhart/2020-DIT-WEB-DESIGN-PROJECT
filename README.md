# 2020-DIT-WEB-DESIGN-PROJECT

This repository is for my 2020 web design project for 7DIT.


RELEASE INFO
It's been a long time coming but I have finally finished the base code for my website. The website is fully functional and only a few improvements need to be made in order to achieve full completion, which will be added in future releases. For my site, I decided to make a business site for the imaginary company called HillCorp. HillCorp pretty much sells technology and I thought it would be a cool way to involve the information about AI whilst including it in the product bios. I thought it would be cool to create the identity of the new biggest company in the world and go wild trying to write their story myself. Below is information on the different pages of my website and the additional files. I will go through all the different aspects of them and will describe their ongoing development. First, I will detail the homepage of my website and will go onto other pages based on the original add date.

SITEMAP RESEARCH
To make sure I had covered all the bases in terms of pages on a big tech company's site, I made sure to do some research on this matter. This research can be found under the "Sitemap Research and Final Sitemap" section on my Miro Board. Through this, I found that every big tech company has a shop on their sites because obviously the main purpose of their sites is to sell their products. Because they have so many products, they also like to split their shop pages into sections depending on the different products. I also found that there are a few special products that each company has that have featured pages with extra information and more marketing for that product. For Apple, it's the new iPhone or iMac, for Samsung maybe its the new galaxy, there is always a product that a company is trying to push to the front. Obviously, every site is in need of a homepage so I definitely had to include a page leading to all different pages on my site. The other things sites include is a newsroom or a blog to show the latest developments in that company's projects or work. Also, lots of websites include a careers page to let people try and pursue a career in the company's field of work. They also include an about us page where people go to find out more information about the company. The final thing that I have seen on most sites has been the option to log-in to a premium service or account. The Support page is also an essential addition. This usually includes valuable information like Contact Us or FAQs. The purpose of this website is to be a perfect hub for the business so I need to make sure that it makes the business look professional and a great company to do business with. Because of these requirements, I must include all of the conventions that I find in my research. Using this research, I managed to create a sitemap for my website below. Key is in the top-right corner and yellow pages are not required, but optional. Blue pages are base requirements that must be included in my site.

home.html
The development of my homepage started very early on in my project, in fact, I had to do some research to get the basic design and colour schemes of my website started. To make sure I wasn't wasting time, I decided to do my research before I made my wireframes. Even though improving wireframes is all well and good and shows proof of improvement, I think sometimes making a bad wireframe just so you can improve it is a timewaster and it is much more efficient to make a really good wireframe first try then try to tweak it based on feedback just to make it perfect. Below is the screenshot of my conventions research on the websites of popular tech companies. I used this to make my two wireframes below, a high fidelity and low fidelity version. I then refined the high fidelity wireframe to create the final design and scheme for my website. In my research, I found that they definitely keep their colour schemes, typography and whitespace tendencies the same over the different pages. The colour schemes are typically bland and are along the black and white spectrum, featuring black, white and multiple greys in between. There is no limit to how many greys companies use because a lot of them look similar, it is just best to use the one that fits best to the situation. It will usually either be a dark or light grey. After choosing their greys, they will often have one or two colours that pop up constantly in the images on their site. For example, the Samsung that uses a mixture of good pinks and purples across their images, giving a sense of colour to an otherwise bland site. It also makes their products stand out from the rest of their site as the only things on the site with colour are the products. The Apple site only has colour on their "Buy" and "Learn More" buttons because these are the call to actions and they need to stand out. They also have colours in their product images to convey the other important information in the site, after all, most sites are for selling product. The Nvidia site fails in terms of colour, they have colour in their headings and in things that aren't important for the user to click on, although, they do use good background colours on their call to action buttons that make them stand out. The typography of any site is typically the same across the whole site. Big headers tend to be the most extreme ends of the colour scheme, such as black, and they are often bold as well. The smaller headers tend to either be black or dark grey and have a lighter font weight than the larger headers. The fonts on each page tend to be the same and using the chrome extension WhatFont, I could see that by looking at the different fonts they used on their pages. Every page typically uses the same family of fonts, which is what I have done on my website. That font is almost always a thin, sans-serif font that looks nice and modern and professional. The fonts aren't blocky but they aren't cursive, so for my site, I decided to use OpenSans, which is a nice and simple Webfont that follows the conventions I have stated. For the whitespace part of my site, I want to follow what Apple have done with their site. They tend to have the absolute minimum of information on their homepage and just put the things that matter on there. This is what Nvidia does wrong. If they had put all the links to the articles that they have on their homepage on a different page then they might have had some more simplicity. Simplicity is key on a homepage and any of the other pages. So, for my site, I decided to keep it nice and simple and use plenty of whitespace.

My miro board research of design conventions

Now, I'm going to get into the design of my homepage. I put the logo in the top left corner, which links to the homepage. That is a convention in almost every website, no matter what they are about, nearly every site has the logo or link to the homepage in the top-left corner. Then, either centred or floated to the left, there is the navbar. A tech site conventionally has one of the two types of navbars I have found. The first, being a bar across the top of the site that has a background colour contrary to the colour of the hero image. It will have text that stands out well against the background and the links are nice and spread apart. This bar across the top of the screen is typically fixed to the top of the screen and either follows the user as they scroll, or folds into a hamburger menu. The other type of navbar has no background bar across the top of the screen and instead just has naked links at the top of the page. These links do not follow you as you scroll as they have no background to distinguish them from the content on the page and avoid clashes, they do sometimes fold into a hamburger menu though. All links change colour when hovered over in both options. For my nav bar, I have chosen the second option because I think it shows more simplicity in my site and I think the more simple the better should be the rule for every site. Nothing Unneccesary should be on my site. My Hero Image is a photo of my most important product with a large, one-word header with a small description. The first thing that a user sees on a site is the most important thing for that company. As my site is on the computer science topic AI and is about selling products, I decided to mix those two together for my hero image and first impressions of the site. I presented my main product of the company that was also AI with a link to learn more about the product instead of buy because I believe that the user should learn about AI and the dangers of it before they go into buying it, even though you can't actually buy it. I decided to include a small bio for the product to give a quick explanation of the product to make sure the user is not confused before going to buy it. The development of the hero image underwent many changes, which I have outlined in my Miro board. I used trial and error using feedback from people to see which one would look the best and I think I came up with a pretty good final product. After that, I added the second most important thing to the purpose of the site, which is the AI section. This section links to a massive page about the implementations and dangers of AI. As my site has the main purpose of actually informing people about AI, this page was a necessary addition and that is why I have it second on my homepage. The design of this was relatively simple. I just had to use photoshop to make sure the background image was light enough to make the black text stand out. I also put the HillCorp logo on the robot to go along with the company's image. The next section I added was the shop feature. I decided to put in a header that had a link to the actual shop so that people could have an easy link to all the products before browsing through the featured products. I once again use the blue links to follow the conventional link styling of any page and to make them stand out as call-to-action buttons amongst the rest of the site's content. For the featured products section, I made sure to use full-page sections for each product, following along the style that Apple and Microsoft have on their websites. It lets the user focus on the only content that matters at that moment for a small portion of their time and actually adds to the very simple and effective design of the site, containing little to no information. I found that companies like Apple and Microsoft go for simplicity as their main design aspect. These sections didn't require much development as I already had a really good idea in my head of what I wanted them to look like. I designed all the logos myself on Adobe photoshop and the only development here was making sure they were the right colours. The next section was the more products section which I decided to make into a flexbox and adjust it space-around so that it is dynamic. I then added animations to it in later updates to improve its look even more. For this section, I decided to include the main categories of products that hadn't been shown in previous sections on the homepage so that the homepage is very much an introduction to the site that links to everything else. After I had completed this, everything on the homepage had been finished and all I had to do was add the footer. The footer has a pretty simple design and after my conventions research, I found that most footers, including the Microsoft, Apple and Samsung footers all have a light grey background with grey links and bigger headers. They often include the copyright details for a website, so I made sure to add that. My homepage underwent many developments before I started coding. This was because I used this page for my wireframes and I completely followed the design of my wireframes to make sure I had the best and most conventional design possible. Not many developments happened after I had made my wireframes as I just had to follow the design. The only improvements I made to the design was adding media query breakpoints to my site to make sure that they responded well to small screens.

For my media queries, I used this code line:

@media only screen and (max-width: 800px){
For most of the sections, the media queries were just correcting the text size and padding around the headings and images. However, for the featured products section, I made the height of the images 50% of the vh instead of 100% because then it keeps the square shape of the images and doesn't make them thin and unreadable. For the More Products section, I changed the flexbox into a 2x2 grid using the code:

display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 30vw 30vw;
grid-template-rows: 47vw 47vw;
This made the more products section very flexible in terms of smaller screens and that is the main rundown for my homepage. I had a very hard time turning the navbar into a hamburger menu when the screen size was below 800px. This took a lot of coding but I ended up following the W3schools tutorial on how to make a dropdown menu and revised it for my site. I won't put the code in here because there is a lot of it and it would take up too much of the screen but you can see it in the CSS for my navbar and I managed to make this appear the same on every page.

I made sure to use vw and vh values instead of px values for my sizes to help the site respond automatically to resizing issues. I will now go through the different pages of my website based on the alphabetical order of their HTML files and I will also give a quick rundown of the Javascript files as well. I will explain the CSS files and the relevant CSS whilst explaining the HTML.

ai.html
I copy and pasted the HTML and CSS code from the navigation and footer bars on my homepage and put them into the AI page to make sure I have continuity across my pages. The AI page's purpose is to fill in all the content that is required for the exam at the end of the year and the main aspect of the computer science topic that I have chosen to base my website on. The background for the hero image didn't undergo much changing development but I did have to photoshop it to make sure the text stood out. The main amount of work that was required for this page was the amount of writing required. I go into an in-depth summary of AI in our world and design wasn't the main focus of this page because there was nothing that I needed to draw the user's attention to. Except for the "Buy Now" buttons, which are blue and bold to send the user to the products page. There weren't many media queries required for this page, only the ones to make the text bigger because using vw values doesn't consistently resize the text to appropriate sizes. If you want to read the writing I did for this page, visit the AI page which is accessible from the second section on the homepage. I have split up the text nicely to appeal to the readers who have trouble reading large blocks of text with no breaks in it. I have also added images to help visualise the reader's experience.

ava.html
This is the main page on my site, or at least the one that features on the hero image on the home page. The navbar and footer have once again been copied over from the homepage to keep continuity. However, the nav bar had to be a different colour and I ran into a whole load of problems. So, to make it easier, I linked just this page to a different stylesheet to the rest, I admit it is not the most efficient way of storing the code, however it did make things a whole lot easier. I had a problem on this page where the navbar links weren't critical but I realised that it was a trick with the eyes. The hero image section had put itself ontop of the navbar but I could still see the navbar because I had set the hero-image as the background-image css attribute instead of making the image an actual part of the content. All I had to do in the end after hours of twisting my brain, was add this line of CSS to the navbar and that fixed the problem.

z-index: 10;
This line of code makes sure that the navbar is at the front of the page and was easier than seeing the exact number needed to bring it to the front. The Hero Image of the AVA page shows the user that AVA is in fact, a robot. With a half-face of a robot and a half face of ava, I used photoshop to make their features line up perfectly. I put headers over each side with contrasting colours to show the different sides of the robot. After that, I wrote some more content about the prospects of AVA. I added a blue "Buy Now" to make sure that I am still selling the AI as she is still a product. After that, I put in a text section with an image to show a robot lab to the user. Then I copied the code from the more products section of the home page and changed the content and images of the section. This page was relatively easy to complete and the media queries were already built-in because I didn't use many new classes for the HTML on the new page. That is all that was required for this page.

careers.html
The careers page was one of the last additions to the website and it was a very easy addition to the site. Because it is the same as the first order info page and the sign-up page, all I had to do was update the input boxes with the relevant placeholders and values. The media queries were all premade for me with the previous pages so not much to write about with this page.

checkout.html and app.js
The checkout page was probably the biggest and most challenging page on my site to create. This was because it was my first page to use JavaScript and I had to follow a large amount of JS tutorials whilst trying to create this page. The design was pretty simply, all I had to do was have an image with an empty src value so I could easily change it with JavaScript to make the design dynamic. After that I had an empty h1 tag and an empty p tag adjacent to the image. I used this design because I think it is easier for the end-user if they see all of the information on the first screen that is shown to them. The buttons underwent development. The first design they had was two separate buttons that had a light-red background that had a slight hover-effect. This was the original design because I had been to visit two shop pages from popular websites like Glassons and TradeMe that all had solid colours as their "Buy" backgrounds, or "Add to cart". I would have added the "Add to cart" feature but after a long time of contemplating, I realised that I didn't have the time and resources to make something that sophisticated. The second design change that the buttons went through was the biggest step towards what they look like now. I noticed that on the Apple site and other big tech sites, the ones I should really be looking at instead of Glassons and TradeMe because they have the same target audience as me, their buttons to buy products had transparent backgrounds and black borders. I decided to follow these designs as they were aesthetically pleasing and they followed the conventions of th websites I was looking at well. The final design change was changing them from separate buttons into one box that had a divider down the middle. This conveys the message that each option is still the main product, just with different options because both options are in the same box. This might remove any confusion in the user's mind. I originally didn't have the navbar as part of the checkout page, but I decided to add it after I saw it might be useful to users to access the other pages from the checkout page incase they suddenly needed to find out more information about the product. I left the src tags on the images, the h1 and p tags, and the h5 and h6 tags which included the content for the buttons, empty. This was to make sure that the content in the tags didn't override the JavaScript trying to change the content to have a dynamic webpage. The CSS for this file didn't need to change with the JS because it was all the same styles for each product, just different content. Now, we get down to the most challenging part of my website to create. I first tried many different options, including using JQueries with the $, I am writing this on a plane so sadly can't go back to previous versions of my code to get examples. However I will show you all the different things I tried. My teacher showed me the localStorage system in class but sadly, I forgot what he mentioned to me and couldn't find it online. This made it very hard for me to work out how to do this page as the localStorage system was crucial to the page. The JQueries didn't work after many, many tests, so I had to try a different system. The next thing I tried was calling a function inside of a script tag in my HTML and the function was in my app.js file.

The code on app.js

function productidchange(number) {
     var productid = number
}
The code embedded inside an anchor tag on checkout.html

onclick="productidchange(1)"
After the variable productid was changed, then the code for changing the content would be called depending on which number that variable was. This code was tested time and time again but sadly, the function never got called and the variable changed. My code for changing the content was working because I tried it without changing the content and it still worked. The code I used for that was:

document.getElementById("[ID name]").innerHTML = "Content]";
I gave an ID to every tag that I needed to change the content in and that was how I targeted the separate elements. For the src on an image, that required a different line of code, which was:

document.getElementById("[ID name]").src = "Images/[Image file name]";
After that, I tried another version of my JS, which included putting invisible text on the shop page which I could use the above code to retrieve and then I could change the variable productid with that. However that didn't work after plenty of testing as well. Finally, I had found the W3Schools page that my teacher had showed me about the localStorage code that I could implement into my site. After I discovered that, I was in the home straight. I added this line of code to the buttons on the shop page that led you to the checkout page:

onclick="localStorage.setItem('productid', '1')"
This would change the localstorage variable 'productid' to '1'. This would then store the variable to be used later on the JS file. Once it had been sent to the JS file, I had to use if operators to check which number was stored in there, then I had to load different content depending on what number it was. Here is the code on the JS page with just the content for the first two items:

var productid = localStorage.getItem("productid");

if (productid == 1) {
    *load content here using the line of code: document.getElementById("[ID name]").innerHTML = "Content]";*
} 
if (productid == 2) {
    *load content here using the line of code: document.getElementById("[ID name]").innerHTML = "Content]";*
} 
*Then repeat this for all 27-28 products*
After this was done, I had to find some way to call the code while the checkout page loaded. I tried putting the code into the function then calling the function on my HTML page using a script tag. However, this again didn't work. I finally found a working method when I realised that if I made the entire JS file act as a function, then called the app.js file, it would load the content on the page and would successfully complete my goal. All I had to do was add an empty script tag linking to app.js:

script src="app.js">
/script>
With that, my checkout page was fully operational and looked damn good as well. This is probably the main feature of my website and was worth the large amount of work that it took to complete. The final additions were the navbar up top and the footer. I also added some media queries in. Only small additions that would make the content load as vertical instead of horizontally aligned. This helped the image still be a readable size instead of being too small for the end-user to actually see. With that, my checkout page was finished.

company.html
This page wasn't hard at all. I didn't have to add much CSS because there was the same amount of content on this page as there was on the ai.html page, which had already loaded the CSS for me. The text writing took a while on this as I had to write up a long history for a company that didn't exist. All the images I took off this page were off a royalty-free and copyright-free website that lets you use the images if you subscribe. I detail this more in my relevant implications research and statements if you would like to take a look at those. I added a few features that weren't on the ai.html page and required different CSS. Those features included grey subheaders to the images to help explain the company's image and give the end-user more visuals as to what the company looks like. The media queries and design development of this page were mainly finished before I even started so the main challenge was writing the monstrous amount of content on this page.

corpalytics.html
Again, this was a very simple page to do. The only CSS and extra content I had to add was the corpalytics logo which lies above the header on the hero image page. I also had to change the positioning on the header because I copied nearly all of the CSS from the ava.css sheet. All I had to do was change the image and the content on the page and add the navbar and footer and I was good to go. Easy page, didn't require much work.

index.html
I realised halfway through the development of my site that I would need to make sure the log-in variable and the order-info variable would all need to be reset to the default before the user loads the homepage. But I couldn't just put these at the top of the homepage because it would then log the user out every time the homepage was loaded, rendering the whole login feature obsolete. I used simple code to load the page, change the variables, then redirect the user to the homepage:

 meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url=home.html"/>
 script>
     localStorage.setItem('loggedin', '1')
     localStorage.setItem('orderid', '2')
 /script>
login.html and login.js
The login page was another page that required heavy JavaScript. I will get to the JS later and just focus on the CSS for now. I followed a tutorial on youtube as to how to design a good login page and then went from there. I changed a few things, including the little image at the top, I added the HillCorp Infinity Logo up there onto that. I then added my own headers and content and little icons that showed up to tie the user some visual indication as to what is required for the log-in form. After that, I added the relevant CSS and moved on. Was a relatively simple page in terms of design this one. The hard part was getting the login feature to work. I went to my homepage and added a little user icon up the top so the user can see whether or not they are logged in. This came with a large number of challenges. I had to make sure that the user was not logged in when they first came to the page, so I added the index.html page and went from there. Sadly, there are no actual benefits that logging into the site gives you. I found it would take too much time and effort to code that in. I also had a small shot at creating a database that would store the login details to make sure that you would have to get the right password to log-in properly. However, I was adamant on making the log-in function actually work. Now, onto how the JS works. Quite simple to get the JS to work here, in fact, the hardest thing was trying to code the CSS to position the elements properly and make sure they would only show up if you are logged in, or in some cases, hovering over the user icon. That was a challenge trying to make a dropdown menu. I basically followed the JS from the app.js page and put this line of code on the log-in button.

onclick="localStorage.setItem('loggedin', '2')"
After that, I linked every page to the login.js script page and every time it loaded. The login.js page looks like this and will change the style of each navbar on every page depending on whether or not the user is logged in or not.

var loggedin = localStorage.getItem("loggedin");
if (loggedin == 1) {
    document.getElementById("nav-profile").src = "";
    document.getElementById("nav-profile").style.border = "none";
    document.getElementById('loginbutton').innerHTML = 'Log In';
    document.getElementById('navigationjs').style.transform = "translate(-2%, 100%)";
} 
if (loggedin == 2) {
    document.getElementById("nav-profile").src = "Images/user-icon.png";
    document.getElementById("nav-profile").style.border = "1px solid black";
    document.getElementById('loginbutton').innerHTML = '';
}
After I put that in, it required not much testing as it worked well. The only thing that required development and testing was the actual CSS for the login. But that worked very well eventually.
This was one of the features I was most proud of adding.

newsroom.html
The newsroom page doesn't require much explanation. It was an easy page to make, not much CSS required, all I had to do was write the blog posts out which took me about 30 minutes. I copied the code from the navbar and footer sections of other pages, just to keep good continuity across the pages.

orderinfo.html
Once again, one of the last additions to the site, meaning I could copy the code from the sign-up or careers page. Either would have been perfect but I can't remember which one I ended up using. The CSS was already set up for me, all I had to do was change the content for the headers and the text boxes.

Screen Shot 2020-06-14 at 7 48 47 PM

orderinfotwo.html and orderinfo.js
This was again, quite simple JS. The CSS and HTML were relatively easy as well. I just had to add media queries to make the content align centre when it went too small. I had to add hr lines above and below to show the separation of orders. The javascript was pretty simple. I just had to take the value from the productid variable when a "buy now" variable had been clicked and then load content depending on which was the last product bought. I added the line of code below to both buttons on the checkout page to make sure that the variable is only changed when a product is bought.

onclick="localStorage.setItem('orderid', localStorage.getItem('productid'))"
Below this is the javascript that turns the localStorage item into a variable then loads content depending on which number the variable displays.

var orderid = localStorage.getItem("orderid");

if (orderid == 1) {
    document.getElementById('order-name').innerHTML = 'AVA Robot';
} 
if (orderid == 2) {
    document.getElementById('order-name').innerHTML = 'AVA App Manuals';
}
This goes all the way up to (orderid == 28) and changes different headings for all of those different products.

shop.html
The shop looks like a very complicated HTML page, but the main effort that was required for this page was the photoshop involved. I photoshopped the logo onto all of the royalty-free images I got and colour corrected them to make them look like different products. I used the more-products section from the home page and just changed the content from that. The more-products section actually already included the media queries that made it snap into a grid. The only JS involved in this page was the onclick="" events added to every anchor tag in the shop. The hero image was also photoshopped together and the header for it was changed from the base template I had. I also added some animations to the grid. The shop was more time-consuming than hard but it had its own challenges.

signup.html
The signup page was the first page I used that had a form and the white background like the careers and orderinfo pages. However, it was easy just to copy the login page and just change the text and remove the symbols because I had a problem that I couldn't seem to fix when it came to adding extra symbols. And I had to add a few more text boxes which were easy in the grand scheme of things. I also had to change the colour of the text that was coming through.

support.html
The support page was once again, not one that required much coding, just a whole load of writing. The only proper coding that was involved was linking to different sections of the website and putting in animations for the icons up the top of the page. But I did go and ask my friends - "If you had a problem with your laptop or phone, what would it be?" This was just so I could get real FAQs and not ones that I had thought of in my head. Although I wouldn't exactly call them real, they're the best I've got so it'll have to do. I did actually put my real contact details in the page so if you're tempted to call them, sure, give me a call and we can chat about why your Surface Pro keeps blowing up. Since they don't exist, if your Surface Pro is in fact blowing up, a psychiatrist might be a better option than me. There's so much writing on this doc that I've resorted to humour. Sorry about that. But being serious, this page was annoying to make, simply because of the writing, not because of the actual code.

CONCLUSION
Overall, I am happy with my website, I think I have used good processes to improve the design and make it look as good as it possibly can, whilst also including all of the required content on the pages. I think it would be hard to distinguish HillCorp from a real company.
