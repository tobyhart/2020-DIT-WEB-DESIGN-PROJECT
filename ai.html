            <h2>The Future of Humanity</h2>
            <p>For many years, the development of intelligent technology has been seen as dangerous and something that could impact humanity greatly. We do agree with both of those statements. However, we see that it can impact humanity in a positive way. It is dangerous, however the process that HillCorp undertakes when dealing with these dangers ensures that they are eliminated and all products are safe. Below, we explain our process on how we ensure the safety of our products. We also describe what the future of humanity will look like when new, advanced technology is implemented. Either way, the future is coming. You just need to make sure you’re ready.</p>

        <h2>Uses of AI</h2>
        <p>Around the world, AI has become a large part in our everyday lives. The initiative “AI for Good” supports institutions around the world using AI to tackle the world’s biggest problems. Organizations like these are great representations of the progressiveness. In fact, AI has a wide range of possible uses. It can be used in the farming industry to help automate farming and predict the growth-times of crops. It can be used in the computer-science industry to create personal online assistants to help with efficiency. It can be used in the education industry to assist and maybe replace the role of a teacher. AI has many uses in the finance industry, including calculating exactly how a stock will turn out or analysing business methods to help maximise efficiency and productivity.
            <br><br>
            The government could use it to learn about people’s voting history to make sure that when they implement a policy it will benefit the majority of the country. It can heavily support the healthcare industry by using AI to diagnose patients and it could even be possible to teach AI to perform surgery. It could provide a boost to the hospitality industry by using robot workers or trip planners based on your likes and dislikes. It could help people search for jobs by taking their passions and economic needs and laying out a plan for them. It could formulate entire marketing plans for a company just by analysing their target audience. In fact, how do you know that this site hasn’t been written by an AI machine?
            <br><br>
            AI has major implications in the military sector, with opportunities to form entire armies which have no flaws because they have the skill and strength of 100 men. Recently, the first few AI music artists have been blowing up around the world because they can create entirely original music, just by analysing a large amount of popular music. AI can write a news article for publishers by analysing articles online once the journalist has done all of the research. You never know, through listening devices and thorough research, AI could take over the journalist’s job as well. </p>

            <p>AI has already taken over plenty of customer service hotlines around the world and AI chatbots on websites to help with issues are becoming increasingly popular. The transportation sector can use AI efficiently as well. Self-driving cars and auto-piloted planes are the ways of the future. The most exciting aspect of AI is definitely the smart cities. HillCorp is developing a smart ciy in South Dakota. A smart city is an entire city running of one database, the layout has been designed by an AI machine to maximise efficiency. It has been built by AI to make sure it is built fast.
                <br><br>
                The most exciting thing is that all public transport and in that fact, any transport in the city will be automated and will run at maximum speeds. The reason high speed traffic is safe in an automated environment is because the self-driving cars can hook up to the same database and sync their trajectories with other vehicles so there is no traffic or collisions. These are all the exciting uses of AI in our society.</p>

        <h2>History of AI</h2>
        <p>AI has powered itself to the forefront of technology through it’s constant ability to be applied when the valuable opportunities arise. It really all started when a man named Isaac Asimov theorised the three laws of robotics in 1942. These laws were put in place to ensure the safety of humans and the wellbeing of the robots. They also got people thinking about a machine’s ability to be conscious. 
            <br><br>
            Then, along came Alan Turing and his “Imitation Game”, commonly known as “The Turing Test. This test features an interrogator and the subject and the interrogator is required to determine whether or not the subject is AI. If the interrogator fails to do so, the subject passes The Turing Test, which is commonly set as the benchmark for proper AI. No machine in our era has ever been capable of passing The Turing Test except for HillCorp’s very own AVA.
            <br><br>
            In 1957, Frank Rosenblatt built the first proper mechanical neural network. This is currently on display at the Smithsonian. It was by no means advanced and was nowhere near passing The Turing Test, but it was an extremely important step in the development of AI. Jump to 1997 and we experience the first AI machine to win at a game of chess with world-champion Garry Kasparov. From there, AI continued to beat humans at nearly every board game, video game and task that was possible.
            <br><br>
            AI was evolving very fast but it had reached a hurdle. No one really knew how to make a sentient being that was human enough to fool the average person. Thats where the HillCorp engineers did a perfect job with AVA. AVA is the new peak in artificial intelligence technology and it is available everywhere. You can get your model of AVA now in our shop.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>AI is a very complex subject. There are many different techniques that people use to create the illusion of artificial intelligence. The most popular being “Cybernetics and Brain Simulation”, where the goal is to create a neural network to simulate the brain’s learning process in a machine. Another would be to create a reactive machine that reacts to whatever it has been given. This technique is common in predetermined chatbots and search engines.
            <br><br>
            Another popular technique is the symbolic AI method. Where the machine can learn by associating symbols with information. A logic-based AI uses algorithmic logic to help the machine choose it’s actions and words correctly. Knowledge-based AI analyses a large database to find patterns and give the AI unlimited knowledge. Knowledge-based AI is a good representation of statistical learning.
            <br><br>
            Artificial intelligence algorithms are generally grouped into three categories. There is Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. In the case of Unsupervised learning, the target output is not predetermined and the subject is expected to form a template or conclusion by itself from the given inputs. In the supervised learning method, the model is fed with different data and the results of the model are compared with the actual target outputs. The model then attempts to minimize it’s errors.</p>

            <p>All AI systems should follow the 5 main principles of AI. Fairness means that systems should treat all people fairly. Reliability and Safety means that AI systems should always be safe and have no chance of getting out of control. Privacy and Security means that systems should all respect the privacy of all humans and their private data is kept secure. Transparency means that an AI system should be understandable and easy to communicate with. Accountability means that the people who created the AI should be accountable for that system's actions.
                <br><br>
                If every system follows those principles there shouldn’t be any problem with AI in our world. If there is a problem, HillCorp has set protocols to be followed when a system gets out of control. These procedures make sure that all of our products are safe, along with the preventative measures that we take. The SRI International AI Center has set requirements for every sentient machine to meet before releasing it to the market. AVA passes all of these requirements with flying colours after rigorous testing of her systems.</p>

        <h2>Ethics and Impact</h2>
        <p>Although AI is here already, its implementation still has a bright pathway into the future. However nothing is free of dangers, and AI has a large amount of those dangers. The main talking point amongst the dangers of AI are the ethical issues surrounding the subject. Much discussion has been done about the job loss due to the automation process of many industries and really, AI will make that worse.
            <br><br>
            A large majority of jobs would still work if a robot was used to automate the process. HillCorp knows this and are trying to combat that by giving people who have lost a job in the past to AI or robotic automation priority when filling new positions in our company to help stabilise the effect of AI’s implementation. However, that won’t stop AI from becoming a new part in our society.
            <br><br>
            Through AI, we can achieve a new peak of society where humans benefit from the helpfulness of AI and we can be free to live our lives instead of being bogged down with work. AI could also transform into self-aware nanotech that could be inserted into our bodies to act as a helpful support to our immune system. Also if we use AI to act as permanent support and welfare workers we could move into an equal society where poverty doesn’t exist anymore.</p>
            <br><br>
        </section>

    <section class="ai-uses-img" id="third-section">
        <div>
            <p>AI has the possibility to make everyone’s lives much easier than they already are. However, nothing is ever perfect. If humans don’t have a purpose in life, or a job, they will start to feel a sense of pointlessness to life. Humans could forget the need to work and could all get into unhealthy habits simply because they need to cure their boredom.
                <br><br>
                However, humans will find a way, they always do. AI will be a part of our future in one way or another. It's not going away any time soon so we need to learn to live alongside it. We need to make sure that human error is minimized otherwise our worst fears will come true. Film and media has shaped the image of AI as a threat to humanity.
                <br><br>
                It would be impossible for AI to be a threat to humanity if all protocols and safety measures were taken by everyone. There is no chance that humanity’s rule over Earth would ever be destroyed by machines if we had a safe approach. But the positive impact of AI shows that it is definitely needed in our future society and the negatives can be reduced as our smartest minds combine.</p>
