            <h2>The Future of Humanity</h2>
            <p>For many years, the development of intelligent technology has been seen as dangerous and something that could impact humanity greatly. We do agree with both of those statements. However, we see that it can impact humanity in a positive way. It is dangerous, however the process that HillCorp undertakes when dealing with these dangers ensures that they are eliminated and all products are safe. Below, we explain our process on how we ensure the safety of our products. We also describe what the future of humanity will look like when new, advanced technology is implemented. Either way, the future is coming. You just need to make sure you’re ready.</p>

        <h2>Uses of AI</h2>
        <p>Around the world, AI has become a large part in our everyday lives. The initiative “AI for Good” supports institutions around the world using AI to tackle the world’s biggest problems. Organations like these are great representations of the progressiveness. In fact, AI has a wide range of possible uses. It can be used in the farming industry to help automate farming and predict the growth-times of crops. It can be used in the computer-science industry to create personal online assistants to help with efficiency. It can be used in the education industry to assist and maybe replace the role of a teacher. AI has many uses in the finance industry, including calculating exactly how a stock will turn out or analysing business methods to help maximise efficiency and productivity. The government could use it to learn about people’s voting history to make sure that when they implement a policy it will benefit the majority of the country. It can heavily support the healthcare industry by using AI to diagnose patients and it could even be possible to teach AI to perform surgery. It could provide a boost to the hospitality industry by using robot workers or trip planners based on your likes and dislikes. It could help people search for jobs by taking their passions and economic needs and laying out a plan for them. It formulate entire marketing plans for a company just by analysing their target audience. In fact, how do you know that this site hasn’t been written by an AI machine? AI has major implications in the military sector, with opportunities to form entire armies which have no flaws because they have the skill and strength of 100 men. Recently, the first few AI music artists have been blowing up around the world because they can create entirely original music, just by analysing a large amount of popular</p>

            <p>music. AI can write a news article for publishers by analysing articles online once the journalist has done all of the research. You never know, through listening devices and thorough research, AI could take over the journalist’s job as well. AI has already taken over plenty of customer service hotlines around the world and AI chatbots on websites to help with issues are becoming increasingly popular. The transportation sector can use AI efficiently as well. Self-driving cars and auto-piloted planes are the ways of the future. The most exciting aspect of AI is definitely the smart cities. HillCorp is developing a smart ciy in South Dakota. A smart city is an entire city running of one database, the layout has been designed by an AI machine to maximise efficiency. It has been built by AI to make sure it is built fast. The most exciting thing is that all public transport and in that fact, any transport in the city will be automated and will run at maximum speeds. The reason high speed traffic is safe in an automated environment is because the self-driving cars can hook up to the same database and sync their trajectories with other vehicles so there is no traffic or collisions. These are all the exciting uses of AI in our soceity.</p>

        <h2>History of AI</h2>
        <p>AI has powered itself to the forefront of technology through it’s constant ability to be applied when the valuable opportunities arise. It really all started when a man named Isaac Asimov theorised the three laws of robotics in 1942. These laws were put in place to ensure the safety of humans and the wellbeing of the robots. They also got people thinking about a machine’s ability to be conscious. Then, along came Alan Turing and his “Imitation Game”, commonly known as “The Turing Test. This test features an interrigator and the subject and the interrigator is required to determine whether or not the subject is AI. If the interrigator fails to do so, the subject passes The Turing Test, which is commonly set as the benchmark for proper AI. No machine in our era has ever been capable of passing The Turing Test except for HillCorp’s very own AVA. In 1957, Frank Rosenblatt built the first proper mechanical neural network. This is currently on display at the Smithsonian. It was by no means advanced and was nowhere near passing The Turing Test, but it was an extremely important step in the development of AI. Jump to 1997 and we experience the first AI machine to win at a game of chess with world-champion Garry Kasparov. From there, AI continued to beat humans at nearly every board game, video game and task that was possible. AI was evolving very fast but it had reached a hurdle. No one really knew how to make a sentient being that was human enough to fool the average person. Thats where the HillCorp engineers did a perfect job with AVA. AVA is the new peak in artificial intelligence technology and it is available everywhere. You can get your model of AVA now in our shop.</p>
